        intro: "Matt Slattery is a born and raised Houstonian that has been cutting hair at Chopper’s Barbershop since 2006. He earned his barber certification from Frazier’s Barber College and is a TDLR certified class A barber. Growing up he was always cutting his friends hair, so he thought he would go to school to do it full time! The things he likes most about being a barber is having a flexible schedule, interacting with clients, building friendships, and giving his customers a barbershop experience that makes them feel great and wanting to come back. In his free time, Matt enjoys spending time with his family, coaching his 3 son’s sports teams, and working out.",
